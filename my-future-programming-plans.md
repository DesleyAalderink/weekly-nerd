# Introduction
The minor is almost over. I had a tough, but fun and most importantly, I learned a lot.
Its time to think about the future. What will I do now? and how do I see myself in the future?

## Some backstory
I started at MBO at the education Interactieve Vormgeving. When I first started programming I hated it. I sucked at it
and I didn't understand it. In my third year I was doing a internship to learn how to code. I was finally understanding
the basics of HTML and CSS. I even designed and made a website for a customer of the company!
I had so much fun programming, that I decided I wanted to continue.
My mentor at the company said I had potential and that I should continue on this path.
After graduating I continued on into the Hogeschool van Amsterdam at the education Communication and Multimedia Design.
Its here where I also entered the minor Web Development.

## Minor self reflection
If the minor has thaught me anything, its that I still have A LOT to learn. 
There was a lot of new stuff I have never heard of (like a server worker, sockets etc.).
If I want to make it big I need to keep up with everything that happens in the programming world.
I'm glad I improved my JavaScript skills (one of my main goals going into the minor) and that I improved my CSS skills.
Seeing how good my classmates were made uncertain about my self but, in the end it made me more determined to improve myself.
I know for certain I want to be a front end developer.

## After the minor
After the minor is 100% over I have to find a internship. Thanks to the minor I have strong portfolio to present. 
The kind of internship I'm looking for is a small young company where I can improve my skills even further.
The best case scenario would be if they offer me a job to stay. I'm not counting for it.
I still think I need to improve a lot if I want to be hired. 
Eventually I want to go into the company a friend of mine has been setting up over the last few years. 
I already did a few jobs for him and he said he would love for me to join the team. 
In his company there are programmers way above my league under which I can study under.
