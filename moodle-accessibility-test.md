# Introduction
After I saw the talk of Ischa Gast at Schiphol talking about accessibility on the internet I got curious. 
In my minor that's linked with my education they always say that accessibility is really important and that you should always
design for it. I wonder, is the internal website from my education made accessible? Let's find out!

## Moodle
Moodle is a platform where we can find our classes and homework. Let's start with a tab navigation.

woa! A skip to content button? That's great! 
that means that the user doesn't have to tab 100x to get to see where he/she came for.
Moodle is of to a good start
