# A dive into developer tools

## Introduction
For the final project of the minor, its up to me to make a code setup with build tools.
We had a basic set up that involves Gulp but, Danny (our mentor) adviced us to start from scratch.
I always wanted to learn more about this subject, so I dove into the web and made a little research for what the project must have.

## Choosing a build tool
There is a huge list of build tools to choose from, but what do I choose?
I started my research by finding out what my project needs. It needed to do the following:

* Insert the data into the HMTL
* Compile the JS and CSS for faster performance
* Make strict code rules for our groep
* Something to make our lifes easier 

## Inert the data into the HTML
I started by going through the list. A quick and easy tool to insert data into HTML is "EJS".
It's something I have experience with because I use it for almost all of my projects. Its fast and easy to use.

## Compiling JS and CSS
This was something new for me. A lot of developers are compiling JS and CSS for a faster performance AND a more functional way to write code. When searching online I found a toold called "Rollup JS" what will do exactly what we want. It will only work with ES6 but, that works out great for us, because we want to work with ES6.

## Strict code rules
Because we are working in a team of 4, we need something to make sure we are using the same code rules. We all need to think on the same line. We need a linter. A good and easy to use linter is "eslint". We can modify the rules to our benefit and it will give good errors for us to see.
