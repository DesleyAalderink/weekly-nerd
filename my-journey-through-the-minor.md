## Introduction
I'm writing this article to explain how I experienced the minor. I'm explaining the struggles, achievements and the fun I had.
My name is Desley Aalderink and I'm studying Communication and Multimedia Design at the hoge school van Amsterdam. I want to be a Front Ender in the workfield and I choose this minor to test my skills and to learn more about the web. I knew my skills weren't on par with the rest of the people going for the minor, but I needed to do this.

## First impressions
In the first week everything seemed pretty great. I liked the clas I was in and hearing about everything we were going to do in the minor made me excited for the things to come. The first few courses seemed pretty interesting and doable. The teacher seemed awesome and really excited to start the minor. I especially liked the classes which focussed on CSS and design. The struggle started when we dove deeper into Javascript.

## Despair
The moment I started losing hope to pass this minor was definitely when I kept failing the courses. When it was going about techniques I never head of, I had a lot to learn. The problem was: I never knew were to start. I was hoping for more exercises or extra courses from the teachers for people who had trouble with this, but this wasn't the case. You were pretty much on your own to figure everything out. Seeing other classmates starting of and going through the projects with ease made me feel really uncertain about my self. I fell into a little depression and was thinking of quitting the minor, but luckily I didn't.

## Hope
My friends helped me through the despair. We were all in the same situation, but we couldn't let it end like this. We focussed on passing most of the failed courses and making the best of everything. We all came together and were in full focus mode. Even in our breaks we were talking about the code problems we encoutered and how to fix it. It was a fun experience and I'm happy that we did it. At the time of writing this article I have passed most of my courses and the projects and I'm excited to present the product of our final project.

## Conclusion
During the minor I had a lot of mixed feelings and most of the time I didn't knew what to do, but thanks to the hard work of me and my friends I can happily say I had a good time. I learned a lot, not only about code, but also life lessons. After the minor is over I can finaly put my skills to the test in the internship I'm going to follow after summer vacation.
